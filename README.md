# OpenCV-Based Autonomous Robot Ball Control Using C and JavaScript

This project demonstrates a web-based application for controlling and managing autonomous robot balls using OpenCV (C) and JavaScript. It allows users to interact with robot balls, control their movement, and implement autonomous features through a website.

## Features

- **Real-Time Robot Control**: Control robot balls' movement via a web interface.
- **Autonomous Behavior**: Autonomous movement using AI algorithms to avoid obstacles and follow specific paths.
- **OpenCV Integration (C)**: Utilize OpenCV (C) for computer vision tasks such as detecting objects and obstacles.
- **JavaScript Front-End**: Interactive and responsive interface for controlling robot balls.
- **Webcam Feed**: Real-time video feed for object detection and tracking.
- **Path Planning**: Basic algorithms for navigating autonomously.

## Prerequisites

- **C Compiler**: Required for compiling OpenCV-based C code.
- **OpenCV (C)**: Ensure OpenCV is installed and configured.
- **Node.js**: To run the JavaScript-based front-end.
